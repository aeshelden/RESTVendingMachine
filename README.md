# RESTVendingMachine

This is a REST API web service that allows users to "purchase" items from a vending machine by clicking "add money" buttons and item ID buttons to make their selection. The web service connects to a database being maintained on Heroku that was provided in context of this project, and the connections are made through Ajax requests. This project demonstrates use of HTML, Bootstrap, and jQuery with some JavaScript.
